4. Scroll to the "Medical Triage" section
5. If documents were uploaded, you'll see a "ðŸ“Ž Medical Documents" section

## Technical Details

### File Storage
- Files are stored in: `storage/app/public/medical_documents/`
- Public access via: `public/storage/medical_documents/`
- Symbolic link created using: `php artisan storage:link`

### File Naming Convention
```
{timestamp}_{uniqueid}_{original_filename}
```
Example: `1728561972_66fb3d8a12345_lab_report.pdf`

### Validation Rules
```php
'medical_documents.*' => 'nullable|file|mimes:pdf,jpg,jpeg,png,doc,docx|max:5120'
```

### Database Structure
The `medical_documents` column stores an array of objects:
```json
[
  {
    "original_name": "lab_report.pdf",
    "stored_name": "1728561972_66fb3d8a12345_lab_report.pdf",
    "path": "medical_documents/1728561972_66fb3d8a12345_lab_report.pdf",
    "size": 245678,
    "mime_type": "application/pdf"
  }
]
```

## Security Considerations

1. **File Validation**: Only specific file types are allowed
2. **File Size Limit**: 5MB per file prevents server overload
3. **Unique Filenames**: Prevents file overwriting and conflicts
4. **Secure Storage**: Files stored outside public directory
5. **Access Control**: Files accessible only through authenticated routes (admin panel)

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Image Preview**: Show thumbnail previews for image files
2. **Virus Scanning**: Integrate antivirus scanning for uploaded files
3. **File Compression**: Automatically compress images to save storage
4. **Download All**: Bulk download option for multiple documents
5. **Document Expiry**: Auto-delete documents after consultation is completed
6. **Patient Portal**: Allow patients to view/manage their uploaded documents

## Environment Variables

No additional environment variables needed. The feature works with existing Laravel storage configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Files not uploading?
- Check file size (must be under 5MB)
- Verify file format is supported
- Ensure storage directory has write permissions: `chmod -R 775 storage`

### Files not accessible?
- Make sure symbolic link exists: `php artisan storage:link`
- Check storage permissions: `chmod -R 775 storage/app/public`

### Download links not working?
- Verify `APP_URL` is set correctly in `.env`
- Ensure public storage symlink exists

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Upload Test**:
   - Book a consultation with different file types
   - Verify files appear in `storage/app/public/medical_documents/`
   - Check database record includes file metadata

2. **Email Test**:
   - Verify emails mention uploaded documents
   - Check document count is accurate

3. **Admin Dashboard Test**:
   - View consultation details
   - Verify documents are displayed
   - Test download functionality

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Try uploading without files (should work)
   - Try uploading multiple files
   - Try uploading files larger than 5MB (should fail with validation)
   - Try uploading unsupported file types (should fail)
