# 💳 Flexible Payment Option - Update Documentation

## ✅ What Changed?

We've updated the system to offer **flexible payment options** to patients. They can now choose to:
- **Pay immediately** after booking (convenient & fast)
- **Pay later** after consultation (our default option)

---

## 📧 Updated Email Flow

### **Consultation Confirmation Email**

When a patient books a consultation, they now receive an email with:

#### 1. **Clear Messaging**
- Main message updated to: *"You can pay now for convenience, or wait until after your consultation - your choice!"*
- Consultation fee shows: *"Pay now or later"* instead of just "Pay after consultation"

#### 2. **Prominent Payment Section** (Only shown if consultation has a fee)

The email now includes a beautiful payment section with:

- **Clear heading**: "💳 Payment Options Available"
- **"Flexible Payment" badge** to highlight the choice
- **Consultation fee** displayed prominently
- **Two options clearly explained**:
  - Option 1: Pay Now (Convenient & Fast) ⚡
  - Option 2: Pay After Consultation (Our Default) 🎯
- **Big "PAY NOW SECURELY" button** that redirects to payment checkout
- **Reassurance text**: "Prefer to pay later? No problem! Simply ignore this section."
- **Payment methods**: Listed as "Bank Transfer • Cards • Mobile Money"

#### 3. **Updated "What Happens Next" Section**
- Changed to: *"Payment can be made now or after your consultation"*

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### **1. Email Template Updated**
**File**: `resources/views/emails/consultation-confirmation.blade.php`

**New Styles Added**:
```css
.payment-section {
    background: linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%);
    color: white;
    padding: 25px;
    text-align: center;
    border-radius: 10px;
    margin: 25px 0;
}

.payment-button {
    display: inline-block;
    background: white;
    color: #667eea;
    padding: 15px 40px;
    font-size: 1.1rem;
    font-weight: bold;
    text-decoration: none;
    border-radius: 50px;
    margin: 15px 0;
    box-shadow: 0 4px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
    transition: transform 0.2s;
}

.optional-tag {
    background: #fff3cd;
    color: #856404;
    padding: 8px 15px;
    border-radius: 20px;
    font-size: 0.85rem;
    font-weight: bold;
    display: inline-block;
    margin: 10px 0;
}
```

**Payment Link**:
```php
{{ url('/payment/request/' . $data['consultation_reference']) }}
```

### **2. Payment Controller Updated**
**File**: `app/Http/Controllers/PaymentController.php`

**Changes Made**:

#### Before:
```php
// Check if consultation is completed
if (!$consultation->isCompleted()) {
    return view('payment.failed', [
        'reference' => $reference,
        'message' => 'This consultation has not been completed yet.'
    ]);
}
```

#### After:
```php
// Check if doctor has consultation fee (removed completion check)
if (!$consultation->doctor || $consultation->doctor->consultation_fee <= 0) {
    return view('payment.failed', [
        'reference' => $reference,
        'message' => 'No payment is required for this consultation.'
    ]);
}
```

**Added Payment Type Tracking**:
- Payments are now labeled as either "Upfront" or "Post-consultation"
- Stored in payment metadata for tracking:
  ```php
  'metadata' => [
      'consultation_reference' => $consultation->reference,
      'consultation_id' => $consultation->id,
      'payment_type' => $isUpfrontPayment ? 'upfront' : 'post_consultation',
  ]
  ```

**Updated Payment Narration**:
```php
'narration' => $paymentType . ' payment for ' . $consultation->doctor->name
```

## 📊 Payment Tracking

### **Admin Dashboard**

Admins can now see:
- Which consultations are paid
- Payment type (upfront or post-consultation) in metadata
- Payment reference and transaction details

### **Payment Metadata**

Each payment now includes:
```json
{
  "consultation_reference": "DOT-xxx",
  "consultation_id": 123,
  "payment_type": "upfront" // or "post_consultation"
}
```

---

## 🔐 Security

- ✅ Payments still processed through **Korapay** secure gateway
- ✅ Payment links are unique per consultation reference
- ✅ Duplicate payments prevented (checks if already paid)
- ✅ SSL/HTTPS encryption for all payment transactions
- ✅ All payment methods supported: Bank Transfer, Cards, Mobile Money

---

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **Payment section only shows** if the consultation has a fee (doctor selected with consultation_fee > 0)
2. **Post-consultation payment emails** still work as before - admin can still send payment requests
3. **Payment link works anytime** - even if sent later, patients can use the link from confirmation email
4. **No double payment** - system checks if consultation already paid before accepting payment
5. **Campaign still "Pay After Consult"** - but with added flexibility to pay earlier if preferred
