## Logo Implementation

### Logo File
- **File:** `public/img/whitelogo.png`
- **Color:** White (for use on colored backgrounds)
- **Format:** PNG with transparency

### CSS Styling
All email templates now include this CSS for the logo:

```css
.header img.logo {
    max-width: 200px;
    height: auto;
    margin: 0 auto 15px;
    display: block;
}
```

### HTML Usage
Logo is embedded using environment variable for dynamic URL:

```html
<img src="{{ env('APP_URL') }}/img/whitelogo.png" alt="DoctorOnTap Logo" class="logo">
```

## Configuration Required

### Environment Variable
Ensure `APP_URL` is set correctly in your `.env` file:

```env
APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

Or for local development:
```env
APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

This ensures the logo loads correctly in all emails regardless of environment.

## Benefits

### Professional Branding
- ✅ Consistent logo placement across all communications
- ✅ Enhances brand recognition
- ✅ Increases email credibility
- ✅ Professional appearance in patient/doctor inboxes

### Technical Advantages
- ✅ Uses environment-based URLs for flexibility
- ✅ Responsive design (scales properly on mobile)

## Logo Display

### Email Header Structure
Each email now follows this structure:

```html
<div class="header">
    <img src="{{ env('APP_URL') }}/img/whitelogo.png" alt="DoctorOnTap Logo" class="logo">
    <h1>[Email Title]</h1>
    <p>[Email Subtitle]</p>
</div>
```

### Visual Appearance
- Logo appears centered at top of header
- 200px maximum width (scales down on mobile)
- 15px margin below logo
- Sits above email title and subtitle

## Testing

### Email Preview Test
To verify logo display:

1. Send a test email using any of the email templates
2. Check inbox for logo display
3. Verify logo loads correctly (not broken image)
4. Test on mobile device for responsive behavior

### Common Issues

#### Logo Not Displaying?
**Problem:** Image shows as broken/missing

**Solutions:**
1. Verify `APP_URL` is set in `.env`
2. Ensure `public/img/whitelogo.png` exists
3. Check file permissions: `chmod 644 public/img/whitelogo.png`
4. Clear cache: `php artisan config:cache`

#### Logo Too Large/Small?
**Problem:** Logo doesn't look right

**Solution:**
Adjust `max-width` in CSS:
```css
.header img.logo {
    max-width: 150px; /* Smaller */
    /* or */
    max-width: 250px; /* Larger */
}
```

To use a different logo:
