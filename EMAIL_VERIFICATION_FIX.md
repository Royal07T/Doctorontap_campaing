# Email Verification Fix

## Problem
The error `Route [verification.verify] not defined` was occurring when users tried to resend verification emails. This happened because Laravel's default email verification was trying to use the default verification route, but we have custom routes for each user type (Doctor, Nurse, Canvasser).

## Solution
Created custom email verification notifications for each user type that use the correct verification routes.

---

## Files Created

### 1. Custom Notification Classes
- **`app/Notifications/NurseVerifyEmail.php`** - Nurse verification notification
- **`app/Notifications/CanvasserVerifyEmail.php`** - Canvasser verification notification
- **`app/Notifications/DoctorVerifyEmail.php`** - Doctor verification notification

Each notification extends Laravel's `VerifyEmail` class and overrides the `verificationUrl()` method to use the correct route for that user type.

### 2. Updated Models
Modified the following models to use custom verification notifications:

- **`app/Models/Nurse.php`** - Added `sendEmailVerificationNotification()` method
- **`app/Models/Canvasser.php`** - Added `sendEmailVerificationNotification()` method
- **`app/Models/Doctor.php`** - Added `sendEmailVerificationNotification()` method

## How It Works

### Before (Broken)
```php
// Default behavior tried to use route('verification.verify')
$user->sendEmailVerificationNotification();
// ❌ Error: Route [verification.verify] not defined
```

### After (Fixed)
```php
// Nurse model now uses:
public function sendEmailVerificationNotification()
{
    $this->notify(new \App\Notifications\NurseVerifyEmail);
}

// This notification uses:
URL::temporarySignedRoute(
    'nurse.verification.verify',  // ✅ Correct route!
    Carbon::now()->addMinutes(60),
    ['id' => $notifiable->getKey(), 'hash' => sha1($notifiable->getEmailForVerification())]
);
```

---

## Routes Used

Each user type has its own verification route:

```php
// Doctor
GET /doctor/email/verify/{id}/{hash} → doctor.verification.verify

// Nurse
GET /nurse/email/verify/{id}/{hash} → nurse.verification.verify

// Canvasser
GET /canvasser/email/verify/{id}/{hash} → canvasser.verification.verify
```

## Verification Pages

All verification pages (`verify-email.blade.php`) already have logout buttons:

### Nurse Verification Page
- `/nurse/email/verify`
- Has "Resend Verification Email" button
- Has "Logout" button ✅

### Canvasser Verification Page
- `/canvasser/email/verify`
- Has "Resend Verification Email" button
- Has "Logout" button ✅

### Doctor Verification Page
- `/doctor/email/verify`
- Has "Resend Verification Email" button
- Has "Logout" button ✅

---

## Testing

### Test Verification Flow:

1. **Create a new user (non-demo):**
   ```php
   // They won't have email_verified_at set
   ```

2. **Try to login:**
   - User will be redirected to verification page
   - See "Please Verify Your Email" message

3. **Click "Resend Verification Email":**
   - ✅ Should work now (no more route error)
   - Email sent with correct verification link

4. **Click verification link in email:**
   - User's email gets verified
   - Redirected to dashboard

5. **Use logout button if needed:**
   - Available on all verification pages

---

## Demo Accounts (Auto-Verified)

Demo accounts don't need email verification:

```bash
# Doctor
doctor@demo.com / password
✅ email_verified_at: set automatically

# Canvasser
canvasser@demo.com / password
✅ email_verified_at: set automatically

# Nurse
nurse@demo.com / password
✅ email_verified_at: set automatically
```

---

## Key Benefits

✅ **Fixed Route Error** - No more `Route [verification.verify] not defined`
✅ **User-Specific Routes** - Each user type uses correct verification URL
✅ **Logout Available** - Users can logout from verification page
✅ **Demo Accounts Skip Verification** - Auto-verified for testing
✅ **Secure Links** - Signed URLs with 60-minute expiry

---

## Summary

The issue was that Laravel's default email verification system uses a generic `verification.verify` route, but we have separate routes for each user type:
- `doctor.verification.verify`
- `nurse.verification.verify`  
- `canvasser.verification.verify`

By creating custom notification classes for each user type, we ensure the correct verification URL is generated in the email, pointing to the right route for that specific user type.

All verification pages already have logout buttons, so users can switch accounts if needed.
